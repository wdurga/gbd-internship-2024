# 2. Youâ€™re trying to match a text pattern using regular expressions, 
# but it is identifying the longest possible matches of a pattern. 
# Instead, you would like to change it to find the shortest possible match. 

# for regex: practise: please visit : https://regex101.com/
# Eg: match the string enclosed inside " "
# 'Computer says "no."' ==> [no.]
# 'Computer says "no." Phone says "yes."' ==> ['no.', 'yes.'] (correct answer)
# ['no." Phone says "yes.'] -> this is wrong

# this re module provides support for regular expressions. 
# Regex are used for pattern matching in the string

# regular expressing pattern to match the shortest string enclosed inside double quotes

# the r prefix before the string indicates a raw string literal, which tells 
# python to intepret backslashes('\') as literal charactrers and not as escape sequences.

# '(.*?)' is a non-greedy or lazy capturing group.
# '.' matches any character except new line
# '?' is the non-greedy quantifier (lazy), means it matches as few charactes as possible.
# '*' occurs zero or more
# r'"(.*?)"' is designed to find= shortest substring enclosed in double quotes.

# find all matches using findall() function
#  it rerturns a list containing all matches found.
